Hello, my name is John Hubert and this is freeware so feel free to distribute it, but keep in mind it uses itext which requires you to include the source code unless you purchase a commercial licensing from them.  http://itextpdf.com/agpl  

Thanks again for trying my free program.  To use it, just unzip the executable and the .DLL file into the same directory, then just open the program and drag and drop the PDF file, or multiple PDF files in order to batch stamp their filenames to the PDF.
